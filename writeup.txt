Design:

Our program utilizes the FUSE API by implementing getattr, readdir, read and open. 

In "getattr", we parse through the given path to find out what file the user is performing a given command on. Once we determine if
the last file in the path is a directory or a regular file, we then assign attributes to it. These attributes include the permissions, 
the number of links and (if it is a regular file) the size.

The "readdir" function parses through path in the same way and upon determining what the directory specified is, it calls the
filler funtion as many times as there are links within the directory. The filler function stores the specifed link names
within a buffer that outputs to the terminal.

"Read" simply parses through in the same way and dtermines if the path is pointing to a regular file. If it is, it then checks the
permissions of the file to see if it has the right to read it. If the file is both not a directory and has read permissions for
the given user, we return a success.

Lastly, "open" determines the path (via parser). Upon confierming that it's a
regular file. We then identify if the file is a doc. If it is, we store the
contents of the doc within memory via the buffer provided to us. If it is not
a doc, then we take the two (or one) number within the path and call the
appropriate funtion via a pointer that points within a struct we've created.
The buffer then outputs it's contents to the terminal.

Test Cases:

1. ls math/

add  div  exp  factor  fib  mul  sub

2. ls -l math/

total 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 oec 31  1969 add
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Dec 31  1969 div
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Dec 31  1969 exp
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Dec 31  1969 factor
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Dec 31  1969 fib
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Dec 31  1969 mul
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Dec 31  1969 sub

3. ls -l math/add/

-r--r--r-- 3 root root 1024 Dec 31  1969 doc

4. cat math/add/doc

Given the path add/x/y, it will output the sum of x and y.

5. cat math/add/2/2

4.000000

6. cat math/add/2/2.5

4.500000

7. cat math/sub/5/5

0.000000

8. cat math/div/10/0

Divide by 0 error.

9. cat math/fib/5
